Work in progress.
 


This is a massive missed opportunity!
The readme should contain:

This repository is for a Javascript exercise I did for Manchester Codes. It involved me creating a virtual pet with the following methods(below) that controls the pets life span - 

You can give them a name .

They can get older.

As they get older, they get hungrier and less fit. 

You can walk the pet to increase it's fitness. 

You can feed the pet to decrease it's hunger. 

You can talk to the pet to see if it needs feeding or walking.

If the pet gets too hungry or unfit, it will DIE.

If the pet gets to 30 days old it will DIE .

Metholigies i used in this project as TTD and OOP
